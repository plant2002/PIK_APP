TO DO:
- [ ]	Make sure it's bulletproof (after presentation, such as that date_from is earlier than date_to, fn_from smaller than fn_to etc)
- [ ]	get the code cleaned up
- [x]	connect GUI to functions
- [x]	show graphs in GUI Analysis
- [x]	change GUI Analysis
- [x]	create a Jupyter notebook with analysis + export in it
- [x]	PowerPoint presentation
- [x]	added client, company, helicopter tables to database
- [x]	client login/register
- [x]	company login/register
- [ ]	add new helicopter GUI + queries
- [ ]	how to make sure it's only one guy adding helicopters for the x company?
- [ ]	how do I link new VEMD .csv to a helicopter that doesn't exist yet (maybe open a new window if I find a FN that isn't yet in the database???)
- [ ]	how do you transfer/delete helicopters from x company to y company?

Analysis: 
- [ ]	make analysis bulletproof
- [ ]	make analysis functions readable and coherent
- [ ]	make analysis functions depend on logged-in client!!!
- [ ]	analysis for all data for deviations??? (from all helicopters in database, all helicopters owned by the company or just that helicopter data?)
- [ ] new functions
-	Basic functions:
- [x] cleaning up CSV 
- [x] database 
- [x] connecting DB to python 
- [x] main page of GUI 
- [x] GUI is okay now 
- [x] GUI connect to other frames works okay, all in one file though (GUI2.py) since the links weren't working as they should in multiple files.
- [x] Clean up GUI_2
- [x] uploading csv files to a folder 'uploads' 
- [x] importing into DB (all works and gets inserted. Failures only when a new code is detected)
- [x] moving csv after it was processed
- [x] reimporting works and rewrites the rows in the database
